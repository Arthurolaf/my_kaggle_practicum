Kaggle workshop<br>
After completing a 1.5 year course in the Data Sceince specialization. In order not to lose my skills, I want to complete tasks with Kaggle. 
What will become my portfolio for the future. 
Today, two months after training, I got a job as a Data Engineer.

According to the plan, for the first month I will complete several easy tasks. Beginner. If it is easy, I will start taking on tasks that are more difficult like Medium. And when I am confident that I solve all the tasks well, I will switch to Hard task.

I will also be working in Jupyter-Notebook to leave comments for myself and others.

Thank you for your interest

Iâ€™ll describe the folder structure either later here or inside each class of tasks
